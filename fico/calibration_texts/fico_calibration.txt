Credit scoring is a sophisticated statistical analysis performed by lenders and creditors to determine the creditworthiness of a person or business. FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better credit and lower risk. The score is calculated based on five key factors: payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), credit mix (10%), and new credit (10%).

Payment history is the most critical factor, accounting for 35% of your score. This includes whether you've paid past credit accounts on time, the severity and recency of any late payments, and the presence of any bankruptcies, foreclosures, or collections. Even a single 30-day late payment can significantly impact your score, with the effect diminishing over time. Consistent on-time payment over 24 months demonstrates reliability to lenders.

Amounts owed (30%) refers primarily to your credit utilization ratio - the percentage of available credit you're currently using. For example, if you have credit cards with a combined limit of $10,000 and you're carrying a balance of $3,000, your utilization is 30%. Experts recommend keeping this ratio below 30%, with optimal scores typically achieved at utilization rates below 10%. Both per-card and overall utilization matter; maxing out even one card while maintaining low balances on others can negatively impact your score.

Length of credit history (15%) considers how long your credit accounts have been open, including the age of your oldest account, newest account, and the average age of all accounts. Closing old accounts can inadvertently harm your score by reducing your average account age. A longer credit history provides more data points for lenders to assess your reliability, which is why maintaining old accounts in good standing is beneficial even if you rarely use them.

Credit mix (10%) evaluates the variety of credit accounts you have. This includes revolving credit (credit cards, lines of credit) and installment loans (auto loans, mortgages, student loans, personal loans). Having experience managing different types of credit demonstrates financial versatility to lenders. However, you should never open unnecessary accounts just to improve your mix.

New credit (10%) includes recent credit inquiries and newly opened accounts. Hard inquiries, which occur when you apply for credit, can temporarily lower your score by a few points. Multiple inquiries for the same type of loan (like mortgage shopping) within a 14-45 day window are typically counted as a single inquiry. Opening several new accounts in a short period signals higher risk to lenders and can significantly impact your score.

FICO score ranges are categorized as follows: Poor (300-579), Fair (580-669), Good (670-739), Very Good (740-799), and Exceptional (800-850). A score of 670 or above is generally required for most conventional loans, while scores above 740 qualify for the best interest rates. The financial impact of score differences can be substantial; for example, on a $300,000 30-year mortgage, the difference between a 620 and 760 credit score could mean paying an additional $90,000 in interest over the life of the loan.

Maintaining a healthy credit score requires consistent on-time payments (set up autopay to never miss due dates), keeping credit utilization below 30% (ideally below 10%), avoiding opening too many new accounts at once, maintaining a diverse mix of credit types, and regularly monitoring your credit reports for errors or fraudulent activity. Financial experts also recommend keeping old accounts open, paying down high balances strategically, and limiting hard inquiries to only necessary credit applications.

Understanding the mathematical formulas behind credit scoring can help optimize your credit strategy. For instance, the monthly interest on a credit card balance is calculated as: Interest = Balance × (APR / 12). If you have a $5,000 balance at 18.5% APR, your first month's interest would be $5,000 × (0.185 / 12) = $77.08. This demonstrates why maintaining high balances is costly and why paying down debt aggressively saves money.

Credit utilization is calculated both per card and in aggregate. If you have three cards with limits of $5,000, $10,000, and $3,000 (total $18,000), and balances of $4,000, $1,000, and $500 (total $5,500), your overall utilization is 30.6%, but your first card is at 80% utilization. This high per-card utilization can negatively impact your score even though overall utilization seems reasonable.

The effective annual rate (EAR) for loans with compound interest differs from the stated APR. For a 12% nominal rate compounded monthly, the EAR is calculated as: EAR = (1 + r/n)^n - 1, where r is the nominal rate and n is the compounding frequency. This gives us (1 + 0.12/12)^12 - 1 = 1.0112681 - 1 = 0.12681 or 12.681%. This higher effective rate explains why borrowers pay more than the stated APR suggests.

Score recovery after negative events follows predictable patterns. A bankruptcy can drop your score by 130-240 points and remains on your report for 7-10 years, but its impact diminishes over time. Within 2-3 years of bankruptcy with responsible credit behavior, it's possible to rebuild to a 700+ score. Late payments have a decreasing impact over time, with the effect halving approximately every 6-12 months for borrowers who maintain perfect payment history afterward.
